        <h1 id="intro">Nice to Meet You!</h1>
        <p id="about">My name is Jorge Hernandez, and I am a 22-year-old recent graduate of Stephen F. Austin State University <br>
            with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I am looking to begin my career as a Software Developer <br>
            and aim to showcase my skills through this website. <br>
            <br>
            I have known that I wanted to major in Computer Science ever since I was in middle school. It first started <br>
            as a desire to develop video games. I began researching online how to become a game developer and learned <br>
            that Computer Science was the perfect field that would allow me to pursue that career, however, it would <br>
            also open the door to other career paths if game development didn't work out. <br>
            <br>
            After taking my introductory Computer Science course, I fell in love with the ability to solve problems <br>
            efficiently. Everywhere I looked, I saw a way to apply what I learned in my class and would generate idea <br>
            after idea for software such as apps and websites that would make my day-to-day life easier. It took one <br>
            attempt at making an app before I quickly realized just how much I had to learn before I would be able <br>
            to make my ideas come to life. <br>
            <br>
            Now I sit at the culmination of my four years of hard work and can confidently say that I am able to make <br>
            efficient, responsive, and practical software. I started with the creation of this website to showcase my web <br>
            development skills in HTML and CSS. Then, I began working on an app which I named “OnTrack” with the purpose <br>
            of facilitating my financial tracking methods. After successfully completing these two projects, I now turn <br>
            to the corporate world to see who I can develop software for that will help more lives than just my own.
